# Terraform-Based-Grafana-Deployment-on-AWS
Terraform-Based Grafana Deployment on AWS
📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform and automatically deploy Grafana on an EC2 instance.
The infrastructure is fully defined as code, with Terraform state stored remotely in Amazon S3 for reliability and best practices.
The goal of this project is to showcase real-world cloud engineering skills, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC), security configuration, automation, and Linux server management.
